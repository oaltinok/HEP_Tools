High Energy Physics Tools
==========================

These following packages are specialized for MINERvA Experiment data format.

There are analysis packages for 2 different data types:
ana: Analysis Output from a specficic analysis package
dst: Standard output file, can be generated from all analysis packages

ANA_CC
Analysis package that used for CCInclusive ana file output.

DST_CC
Analysis package that used with DST files.


MATLAB functions used in High Energy Physics
Note: After July 2013, I started to use ROOT for visualization instead of MATLAB, these packages will not be updated.

Visualization:
	x-y Scatter Plots
  	Single Histograms
  	Data vs MC Comparison
Data Statistics:
 	Chi-square Calculation
  	radian to degree converter
