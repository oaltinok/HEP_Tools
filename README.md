High Energy Physics Tools
==========================

These following packages are specialized for MINERvA Experiment data format.

There are analysis packages for 2 different data types:

ana: Analysis Output from a specficic analysis package

dst: Standard output file, can be generated from all analysis packages

DataAnalyze/ANA_CC
------------------------
Analysis package that used for CCInclusive ana file output.

DataAnalyze/DST_CC
------------------------
Analysis package that used with DST files.


Plotting
------------------------
Note: After July 2013, I started to use ROOT for visualization instead of MATLAB, these packages will not be updated.

Visualization:

	x-y Scatter Plots
	
  	Single Histograms
  	
  	Data vs MC Comparison
  	
Data Statistics:

 	Chi-square Calculation
 	
  	radian to degree converter
